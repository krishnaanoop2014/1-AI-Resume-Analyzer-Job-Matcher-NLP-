# AI Resume Analyzer & Job Matching System

An end-to-end NLP-based application that analyzes resumes and matches them with job descriptions using text similarity techniques. This project demonstrates practical Natural Language Processing (NLP), data preprocessing, and deployment-ready AI application development.
